The Neurobehavior Ontology (NBO) consists of two main components, an
ontology of behavioral processes and an ontology of behavioral phenotypes.
The behavioral process branch of NBO contains a classification of behavior
processes complementing and extending GO’s process ontology. The behavior
phenotype branch of NBO consists of a classification of both normal and
abnormal behavioral characteristics of organisms

NBO’s prime application is to provide the vocabulary that is required to integrate
behavior observations within and across species. It is currently being applied by several model organism communities as well as in the description
of human behavior-related disease phenotypes.

The main ontology is available in both the OBO Flatfile Format and the Web Ontology Language (OWL)
