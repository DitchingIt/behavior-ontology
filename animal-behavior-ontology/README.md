This repository currently contains two files:
* The owl version of the abocore ontology.  This was generated from the Protege frames files in 2006.
* The additional/extended/improved definitions developed during the ethosearch project.  The first column refers to the label of the abo term, which should be, but isn't always the local portion of the uri for the term.
